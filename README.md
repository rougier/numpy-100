## 100 numpy exercises

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/rougier/numpy-100/notebooks/100%20Numpy%20exercises.ipynb)

This is a collection of exercises that have been collected in the numpy mailing
list, on stack overflow and in the numpy documentation. I've also created some
to reach the 100 limit. The goal of this collection is to offer a quick
reference for both old and new users but also to provide a set of exercices for
those who teach.
